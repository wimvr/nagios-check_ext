* 0.4 (released 3.2.2022)
  - Past now, always round up instead of default down. This prevents 0 counting as 2 days (-0.9 - 0.9).

* 0.3 (released 31.1.2022)
  - Warning/critical only if days below limit, not almost at limit. This prevents server restarts a day too early.

* 0.2 (released 30.1.2021)
  - rename check from check_ext_disks to check_ext_fs to better match what it really does
  - only call dumpe2fs one time per filesystem and reuse result
  - show filesystem count in status message
  - mention all problems of higest severity, not only first
  - verbose output in case of OK status
  - download package with name and version, not only version

* 0.1 (released 26.1.2021)
  - Initial version
